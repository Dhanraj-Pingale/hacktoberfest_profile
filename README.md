# MLSC Hacktoberfest Starter Repository 
"Hacktoberfest" is an annual month-long event in October that encourages open-source contributions by developers worldwide. Participants work on open-source projects, submit pull requests, and earn limited-edition swag while supporting the open-source community.

## Getting Started
Welcome to Hacktoberfest! If you want to contribute to this repository and help others get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Create a Folder:**
   - Make a folder with your name in the following format: `firstName_lastName`.
     For example, if your name is John Smith, your folder should be named `John_Smith`.

2. **Add Your Files:**
   - Inside your folder, include the following files:
     - `index.html`: This is your main HTML file.
     - `photo.jpg`: Include a profile picture of yourself (optional but encouraged).
     - Any additional CSS or JavaScript files you want to include in your project (if applicable).

3. **Update data.json:**
   - Open the `data.json` file in the root directory.
   - Add your name (in the same format as your folder name) to the JSON file under the appropriate category or section. You can provide additional information about your project or your goals for Hacktoberfest if you wish.

4. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Once you've added your folder and updated `data.json`, create a pull request to submit your changes.

5. **Contribute and Collaborate:**
   - Feel free to collaborate with others, provide feedback, or improve existing projects.
   - You can also use this opportunity to learn from others and make meaningful contributions to open source.
